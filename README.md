# It is Quiz time

In this project i want to be able to make a quiz that has a timer built into the function.

I want to make this a multipal choice quiz .

When you get it wrong i want to make a penalty.

I learned that i need to make sure that my spelling is correct or my functions like css ex work right.

need to remember to use right indicator for id and class (#,.)
